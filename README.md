# Python Setup for DobotMagician using Dobot's API
## Required Equipment and Setup:
Dobot Magician('s) that are already set up with suction, gripper, and/or conveyer belt

Helpful github page that gives instructions of how to set up Dobot plus how to download control software: https://github.com/SERLatBTH/StarterGuide-DobotMagician?tab=readme-ov-file

A working webcam setup is required to use opencv (I am using an intel webcam)

## What will be covered:
- How to control one Dobot
- How to control multiple Dobots
- How to control conveyer belt
- How to use opencv adjacent to dobots (detecting the largeest areas of yellow and green and capturing the center of that object)(the center of the object is not being used in the project, only the color detection part is)

## How to improve this project:
 - coordinate dobot coordinates to the camera coordinate's center of the object(which I have already done), so that pick and place is not hardcoded 
 - train yolo on dobot blocks for streamlined object detection (not sure about this actually)
 - instead of one block by one block, capture multiple cubes on the conveyer belt and calculate center points of each block
 - detect all shapes and then find the center of that object WITHOUT sorting by color

## Packages Needed
install V2 dobot files and unzip them: https://www.dobot.us/download/dobot-demo-v2-0/ 

install driver suitable for your computer: https://www.silabs.com/developers/usb-to-uart-bridge-vcp-drivers?tab=downloads

## Setup Code Instructions

download Dobot Demo (DOBOT Magician) v2.3 Â· Aug 23, 2021 off of https://www.dobot-robots.com/service/download-center?keyword=&products%5B%5D=316

download latest 32 bit python version suitable for your computer: https://www.python.org/downloads/release/python-3120/

I AM USING Python 3.12 32 bit version for Windows

install VS studio code: https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/setup/setup-overview

create virtual envirnoment on VS studio code with latest python 32 bit version as interpreter: https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/python/environments

open the DobotDemoForPython folder from the v2 files in virtual envirnoment

in the DobotDemoForPython folder read DobotD11Type.py and DobotControl.py to understand documentation and usage 

pip install cv2 and pySerial

copy and paste my opencvmethods code into a new file in your virtual workspace and name the file opencvmethods.py
